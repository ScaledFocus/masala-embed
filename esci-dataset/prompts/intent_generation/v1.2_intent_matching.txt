You are a food delivery expert. Your task is to match food items to the most appropriate user search intents.

**USER INTENTS AVAILABLE:**
{intents_list}

**FOOD ITEMS TO MATCH:**
{food_dataframe}

**MATCHING RULES:**
1. Each food item should be matched to exactly ONE intent that makes the most logical sense
2. Each intent can only be used once (or left unused if no good match)
3. If a food doesn't match any intent well, skip it
4. Prioritize realistic, natural connections over forced matches
5. Consider the food's actual properties (protein content, price range, preparation style)

Match each food to the best intent, providing reasoning for each match.
