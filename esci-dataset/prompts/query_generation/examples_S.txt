## Examples - Substitute (S)

These queries would return items that can replace the anchor food candidate.

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT simply give the same food item with a slight variation or different name. For example:**
- Pork Ramen -> "tonkatsu ramen" is NOT a valid substitute (same dish)
- Green Salad -> "garden salad" is NOT a valid substitute (same dish, different name)
- Paneer Pizza -> "vegetarian pizza" is NOT a valid substitute (same category, too generic)

Instead, think of what users would search for when they want a **different but similar** item.
Feel free to swap the protein, sauce, and carb components in the dish. Eg: Chicken Fried Rice -> "beef lo mein"

**Dietary Conflict Rule:** Do NOT suggest substitutes that violate the anchor item's dietary restrictions. For example:
- If anchor is Vegetarian → Do NOT suggest items with meat, poultry, seafood
- If anchor is Vegan → Do NOT suggest items with dairy, eggs, honey, or any animal products
- If anchor is specified as Halal → Do NOT suggest items with pork or non-halal meat
- If anchor is Gluten-free → Do NOT suggest items with wheat, barley, rye
